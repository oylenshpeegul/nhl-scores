* Down the rabbit hole! 

The original nhl-235 page highlighted the Finnish players in green, apparently. In thinking about how to do that, I thought it might be fun to put a flag for the nationality of every player. Unicode has flags, but my terminal wouldn't display them. I installed [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]], which did.
